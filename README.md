###  OJT static sites
This is a template website. When I was an intern, my task was to create the company's website, but now I decided to share this code for other people, finding templates.


### Demo

http://jannbriza-static-site-ojt.surge.sh/


### This is a static website, with the help of Bootstrap and CSS customization.

## Deployment

I used 'surge' for deployment. See surge here `https://surge.sh/` for more details.
